Statistics for Python
=====================

INSTALLATION
============

In the top directory (containing setup.py and also this README file), type
  python setup.py config
  python setup.py build
  python setup.py install

You will need an ANSI C compiler such as GNU gcc, as well as the Numerical
Python package. As of release 0.18 of Statistics for Python, you will need
the "new" Numerical Python (NumPy version 1.1.1 or higher).

The first step 'python setup.py config' runs a number of trial programs to
discover the contents of the math library on your computer. This step may
fail with Python versions older than 2.3. If so, it's safe to skip it, though
that will disable some features in this software. The trial programs may
generate error and warning messages; these can be ignored. Be sure that the
current directory ('.') is in the PATH, so that Python can find the trial
programs.

You may need to log in as root the install this module. If you do not have root
access, do
  python setup.py install --prefix=/some/other/directory
and set the environment variable
  PYTHONPATH=/some/other/directory/lib/python2.2/site-packages
The exact command depends on which shell you are using; the exact path will
depend on the version of Python you are using.

A Windows installer for the Statistics for Python extendion module is available
from our website (http://bonsai.ims.u-tokyo.ac.jp/~mdehoon/software/python).
